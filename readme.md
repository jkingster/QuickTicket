# Welcome to the repo of QuickTicket.

###### Your free-to-use ticket management solution. Streamlined and lightweight, effortlessly prioritize tasks, manage employees, and assign tickets with precision. Simplify your workflow whether you're a technician or a time-management enthusiast. Plus, it's free and open-source.

###### Originally made to help me manage a local businesses support requests, I've decided why not provide it everyone else. It mainly serves as a ticket solution to those IT technicians without any popular ticket service at their disposal.
